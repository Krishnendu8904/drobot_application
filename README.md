I'm writing to express my interest in the Robotics Internship at Drobot. I'm Krishnendu Chowdhury, a second-year Mechanical Engineering student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, eager to learn more about robotics.

I've always been interested in robots and how they work. To explore this passion, I participated in competitions like Robocon and Flipkart Grid. These experiences were eye-opening, showing me the challenges and teamwork involved in building robots.
I'm also learning 3D modelling and Gazebo simulations, which I think will be helpful in building robots. I'm a quick learner and always willing to put in the extra effort to understand new things.

I believe this internship would be a fantastic opportunity to learn from experienced professionals at Drobot and contribute to exciting projects. I've attached my resume for your review.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Krishnendu Chowdhury
